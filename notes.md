## Day 1 - Initial commit and environment setup
**Date:** 2025-11-17

**What I did:**
- Installed Python, VS Code, Git
- Created GitHub repo
- Wrote first Python program `day1_hello.py`
- Pushed initial commit to GitHub
- Started freeCodeCamp Python Certification

**File(s):**
`day1_hello.py`

**Key Lessons / Notes:**
- Python basics: `print()` and `input()`
- How to run a script in VS Code
- Version control: commit, push

**Issues / Fixes:**
- None on Day 1

## Day 2 - Added Python basic calculator script
**Date:** 2025-11-19

**What I did:**
- Practiced converting input to numbers with `float`
- Built small calculator to add two numbers
- Increased variables and calculations to include subtraction, multiplication and division
- Pushed updated script to GitHub
- Completed 5 freeCodeCamp lessons in Introduction to Python

**File(s):**
`day2_basics.py`

**Key Lessons / Notes:**
- Always type valid numbers into `input()`
- Debugged `ValueError` from invalid float conversion
- Reminder to double check sequence for typing errors
- GitHub workflow: `add`, `commit`, `push`

**Issues / Fixes:**
- `ValueError` occurred when trying to substitute the number directly into the `input()` prompt
- Entered numbers in the code line itself instead of creating the prompt
- Fixed by keeping the prompt text static and typing numbers in terminal

## Day 3 - Conditional logic and loops
**Date:** 2025-11-19

**What I did:**
- Learned `for` loops and `range()`
- Built a script to count by 1, 2, or 5
- Experimented counting by various multiples, 2s or 5s, both positive and negative directions
- Experimented with `range(start, stop, step)`
- Pushed updated script to GitHub using VS Code Source Control
- Created automated script that appends a new day entry to notes.md
- Amended code to atuomatically detect the last day and incrememnt the day number
- Amended code to append a formatted Markdown heading and template to notes.md
- Amended code to automatically add a Table of Contents (TOC) entry at the top

**File(s):**
`day3_loops.py`

**Key Lessons / Notes:**
- `range(start, stop, step)` controls counting
- Step can be negative to count down
- Learned how to make counting flexible with step values

**Issues / Fixes:**
- None on Day 3
